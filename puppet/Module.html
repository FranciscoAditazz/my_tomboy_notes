A Puppet module is a self-contained bundle of code and data, organized around a particular purpose. The code would encompass manifests, the data would include all the source files, templates etc that you need to accomplish the purpose of the module.

If resources and classes are the atoms and molecules of Puppet, we might consider modules our amoebas: the first self-contained organisms of the Puppet world. In actual practice, every <a style="color:#204A87" href="Manifest.html">manifest</a> should be contained within a module.

Simple put, a Module is a directory with a specific structure - <span style="background:yellow">a means for us to package everything needed to achieve a certain goal</span>. Once we agree to stick to this standard way of doing this, a significant benefit is the ability to share our work, such that others who seek to achieve the same goal can re-use our work. The Forge is the central location where you can find modules that have been developed by others (<a style="color:#3465A4" href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/">https://forge.puppetlabs.com/</a>). The vast majority of the necessary code had already been written, tested, documented, and published to the Puppet Forge.

Modules provide a structure to make these collections of pre-written Puppet code, well, modular. In order to enable Puppet to access the classes and types defined in a module's manifests, modules give us a standard pattern for the organization of and naming of Puppet manifests and other resources.

All modules are located in a directory specified by the modulepath variable in Puppet's configuration file. On the Learning VM, Puppet's configuration file can be found at <a style="color:#3465A4" href="/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf</a> .

<b>Module Path</b>
If you're ever wondering where your <span style="font-family:monospace">modulepath</span> is, you can find it by running the puppet agent command with the --<span style="font-family:monospace">configprint</span> flag and specifying <span style="font-family:monospace">modulepath</span>:

	<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">puppet agent --configprint modulepath</span></span>   
	<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">#  the command prints:  <a style="color:#3465A4" href="/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</a></span></span>

What the returned value tells us is that Puppet will look in the directories <a style="color:#3465A4" href="/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules</a> and then in <a style="color:#3465A4" href="/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules">/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</a> to find the modules in use on the system. Classes and types defined by modules in these directories will be available to Puppet.
