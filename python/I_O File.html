<b>open()</b>
	<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">f = open("output.txt", "w")</span></span>
This told Python to open output.txt in "w" mode ("w" stands for "write"). We stored the result of this operation in a file object, f.

passing "r+" as a second argument to the <a style="color:#204A87" href="Function.html">function</a>, the file will allow you to read and write to it!

<b>write()</b>
We can write to a Python file like so:
	<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">my_file.write("Data to be written")</span></span>

<b>close()</b>
You must close the file by calling my_file.close(). If you don't close your file, Python won't write to it properly. From here on out, you gotta close your files!

During the I/O process, data is buffered: this means that it is held in a temporary location before being written to the file.

Python doesn't flush the buffer—that is, write data to the file—until it's sure you're done writing. One way to do this is to close the file. If you write to a file without closing, the data won't make it to the target file.

<b>read()
</b><span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">	my_file = open("output.txt", "r")
	<a style="color:#204A87" href="Print.html">print</a></span></span><span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace"> my_file.read()
	my_file.close()
</span></span>
<b>readline()</b>
Python includes a readline() <a style="color:#204A87" href="Function.html">function</a> that reads from a file line by line, rather than pulling the entire file in at once


<b>The 'with' and 'as' Keywords</b>
There's a way to get Python to automatically close our files for us.

File objects contain a special pair of built-in methods: <b>__enter__()</b> and <b>__exit__()</b>. When a file object's __exit__() method is invoked, it automatically closes the file:
<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">	with open("file", "mode") as variable:
	    # Read or write to the file
</span></span>example:
<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">	with open("text.txt", "w") as textfile:
		textfile.write("Success!")</span></span>

<b>Case Closed?</b>
Is a way to test whether a file we've opened is closed. Python file objects have a closed attribute which is True when the file is closed and False otherwise.
<span style="font-size:small"><span style="font-family:monospace">	f = open("bg.txt")
	f.closed  # False
	f.close()
	f.closed  # True</span></span></div></body></html>
